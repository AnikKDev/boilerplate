# Branching Strategy

1. Each template should have its own dedicated branch.
2. All branches must be created from the `main` branch.
3. Each branch must include a `README.md` file that explains how to use the template.
4. Before working on or pushing to any branch, an issue must be created.
5. The issue should have a proper heading that describes the purpose of the branch (e.g., architecture, tech stack, etc.).
6. The branch name should follow the corresponding issue number and a short description of the template.
   > Example: `1/node-paypal-integration`
   - `1` represents the issue number.
   - `node-paypal-integration` is the short name for the branch.
